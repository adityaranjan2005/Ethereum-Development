Does it Contain the Word?
With the trie we should be able to quickly figure out if the data structure contains a word we are looking for.

For example, if we were to add a few words:

const trie = new Trie();
trie.insert('happy');
trie.insert('healthy');
We should be able to check for those words:

console.log( trie.contains('happy') ); // true
console.log( trie.contains('healthy') ); // true
Without it picking up on words that aren't contained:

console.log( trie.contains('whimsical') ); // false
console.log( trie.contains('health') ); // false
 Because these words are not in the trie, it should return false.

 Notice that second example is a bit tricky! The word "healthy" is in the trie, while the word "health" is not.

 Your Goal: Implement Contains
Add a function contains to the Trie class.

This function should take a string word and return true/false depending on whether the word is in our trie or not.
