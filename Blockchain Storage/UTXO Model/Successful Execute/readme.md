## Successful Transaction
When a transaction is successful and mined to the blockchain, the output UTXOs become new TXOs that are ready to be spent. The input UTXOs need to be marked as spent, to ensure that they are not spent again!

After all, the whole purpose of the blockchain is to fix the double-spend problem 

# Your Goal: Mark Inputs as Spent
If no errors are thrown during the execute function of the transaction, then it is successful!
